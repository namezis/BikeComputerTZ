Simple working example of using .NET Micro for your push bike statistics. I have used FEZ Panda as main board.

The project was created more for fun and education. I have used it when riding to work. The display was consuming far too much energy.

I have new oLED display connected to I2C, when I find time I will make adjustments to the code.

The sensor was a reed switch with magent drilled into M10 bolt fixed on a wheel.

Some of the code I have scavenged from projects on the Internet. Credits preserved.

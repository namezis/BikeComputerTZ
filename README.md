Simple working example of using .NET Micro for your push bike statistics. I have used FEZ Panda and main board.

It is more for fun, I have used it when riding to work. The display was consuming far too much energy.

I have new oLED display connected to I2C, when I find time I will make adjustments to the code.

Some of the code I have scavenged from projects on the Internet. Credits preserved.
